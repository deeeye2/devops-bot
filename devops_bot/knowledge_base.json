    {
      "problem": "disk space",
      "solution": "Check disk usage with 'df -h' and clear unnecessary files. Use 'du -sh *' to find large directories."

      "problem": "high CPU usage",
      "solution": "Identify the process causing high CPU usage with 'top' or 'htop'. Investigate further by checking application logs."

      "problem": "memory leak",
      "solution": "Use 'free -m' to check memory usage, and 'ps aux --sort=-%mem | head' to identify processes with high memory usage. Restart the problematic services."

    {
      "problem": "network issues",
      "solution": "Use 'ping', 'traceroute', and 'netstat' to diagnose network issues. Check firewall rules and network configurations."
